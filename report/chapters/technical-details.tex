\subsubsection{Library Review}

Different libraries have been tested for the implementation of the methods, an
overview is shown in Table \ref{tab:libraries}.
The surprise library was chosen
for its high performance thanks to customizability, great ease of startup
 (installation \& system requriements), ease of use and big variety of
 implemented algorithms for recommender systems.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
   & startup & ease of use & performance & variety \\
  \hline 
  graphlab \cite{graphlab}   & \two & \thr & \one & \two \\
  pyspark \cite{pyspark}    & \one & \one & \two & \thr \\
  surprise \cite{surprise}   & \thr & \thr & \thr & \two \\
  fancyinput \cite{fancyimpute} & \thr & \thr & \two & \one \\
