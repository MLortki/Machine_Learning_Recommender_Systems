A. Recommender systems overview

Categorization of recommender systems (follows [1])

1. Content-based approach

use externally provided information on users or movies (demographic, box office
rankings, popularity, etc.)

2. Collaborative filtering

use previous ratings only, no externally provided information
information available can be categorized in
- implicit feedback (frequency of clicks, minutes of watching tv-show [1], etc.
problems: more difficult to link user behaviour to actual preference (for
example no negative feedback possible)
- explicit feedback (ratings [netflix challenge])
problems: scale of ratings arbitrary, might be interpreted differently by
different users.

2.a neighborhood models

- item-oriented models
- user-oriented models
find k items/users that are most similar to unknown [user/item] pair and predict
rating/behaviour by weighted average.

2.b latent factor models

- use representation of k


B. Methods for solving collaborative filtering with latent factor models.

Different methods (follows [2])

1. SGD
2. Bias SGD (B-SGD)
to account for
3. ALS
4. Weighted ALS
for implicit feedback.

in [2], ALS is best for sparse datasets while SGD is best for
in [3], they say that ALS is better for implicit feedback, but SGD is faster and
easier than ALS.
in [4], many methods to include neighborhood feedback are suggested.

Problem with netflix solutions:
in [5] temporal data used a lot! we cannot do that...
