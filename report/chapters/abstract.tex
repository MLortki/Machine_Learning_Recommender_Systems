In this course project, a recommender system for the Netflix Prize dataset
consisting of ratings of 1'000 users for 10'000 movies is implemented and tested. 
First, latent feature models are proposed using stochastic
gradient descent or alternating least squares for the matrix factorization. Secondly,
neighborhood and baseline models such as k-nearest neighbors are added to capture
similarities between users and/or items for better predictions. ALS scores best
in terms of rmse (0.98418) and promising results for linear blending of different
methods are presented (0.98490).
