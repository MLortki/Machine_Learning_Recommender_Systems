\subsubsection{Data analysis}

The data provided is of the form 
\begin{equation}
  \fat{X} = (x_{nd}),
\end{equation}
where $x_{nd}$ corresponds to the rating of user $d$ for movie $n$.  
the ratings are discrete and go from 1 to 5. Since every user only rates a
very small subset of movies, the matrix is sparse. The data has the following
characteristics.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The trainig set provided has 991561 non-zero entries, which corresponds to 
a fraction of $f_{train} \approx 0.1$ with respect to the number of unknowns($N \times $D). 
  \item Each user in the dataset has rated at least 8 movies, the maximum
    ratings per user is 4590. On average, a user rates roughly 1177 movies.
  \item Each movie in the dataset is rated by at least 3 users, and the maximum
    of ratings per movie is 522. On average, each move is rated by around 118
    users. 
\end{itemize}

ToDo: describe how we split the data

\subsubsection{Bias correction}
\label{sec:biascorrection}

Since users and movies can vary a lot in terms of their average ratings, i.e. some
users might give generally give more positive ratings than others and some
movies might be more negative than others, there might be some implicit bias in
the data provided. 
This biais was removed as follows by subtracting a correcting term from each
element,
\begin{align}
  \widetilde{x}_{nd} &= x_{nd}-\mu_{nd} \\
  \mu_{nd} &=
 \begin{cases}
  \mu_{n} = \inv{|R(n)|} \sum_{d \in R(n)} x_{nd}, &\text{for item bias only}   \\
\mu_{d} = \inv{|R(d)|} \sum_{n \in R(d)} x_{nd}, &\text{for user bias only} \\
\mu = \inv{|R(n,d)|}\sum_{n,d \in R(n,d)} x_{nd}, &\text{for global bias only}
   \\
  \mu_{n} + \mu_{d} - \mu &\text{for combined biais}
 \end{cases}, 
  \label{eq:biases}
\end{align}
where the last term corresponds to what is used in \cite{Koren2009}. 
The entries of the residual matrix, $\widetilde{x}_{nd}$ are then factorized as explained
in \ref{sec:methods} and the bias is added again for the final predictions.

  substracting the mean of the corresponding user. The matrix composed of these
  means and the biases sum up to the original training matrix as expected.}

\end{figure}

As expected, the combined bias with underlying assumption that each rating can
be composed of a contribution by the user and one by the item, is the most
accurate model. \ref{fig:bias}
