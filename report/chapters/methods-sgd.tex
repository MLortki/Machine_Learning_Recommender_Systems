The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm used in this report is provided by the
\textit{Surprise} library
\footnote{\href{}{https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise}} by Nicolas Hug.  
It is based on the algorithm provided by  
Simon Funk \footnote{\href{}{http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html}}, 
which uses bias correction as described in \cite{Koren2009}. 
Without this bias correction, it reduces to the algorithm given in \cite{Salak2008}. 

As shown in \ref{sec:biascorrection} and by \cite{Aberger}, we expect better predictions when removing
the user and item biases, so we choose to use this correction and we choose the
other hyperparameters using cross-validation.
