The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm used in this report is provided by the
\textit{Surprise} library \cite{surprise}.
It is based on the algorithm provided by 
Simon Funk \footnote{\href{}{http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html}}, 
which uses bias correction as described in \cite{Koren2009}, which minimizes the
cost function as defined in \eqref{eq:sgd}.
Without this bias correction, it reduces to the algorithm given in \cite{Salak2008}. 

As shown in \ref{sec:biascorrection} and by \cite{Aberger2009}, we expect better predictions when removing
the user and item biases, so we choose to use this correction and we choose the
other hyperparameters using cross-validation.
