\section{Conclusion}

Both latent factor models and neighborhood models have been trained for the 
collaborative filtering problem proposed in the Netflix Grand Prize competition.
The matrix factorization for the latent factor models was done using ALS and
B-SGD, with the number of latent features and the optimization parameters
determined empirically using k-fold crossvalidation. 
The best prediction was obtained using ALS, but B-SGD improved similarly well.
The blending of these methods with neighborhood models such as item- or
user-based KNN has proven promising, leading to more varied predictions.
