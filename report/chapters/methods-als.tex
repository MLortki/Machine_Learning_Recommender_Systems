Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm used in this report is implemented by us from scratch. We decided to use Tikhonov relugarizer instead of the normal one, because [] claimed it prevented model from overfitting. Our observation is, that it works well when number of laten features is below 50, but otherwise it's not that a big help. Todo:simple formula with explanation
We observed that solving normal equations for each row of W and Z are independent on other rows, which gives us possibility to seperate them.
[formula blablabla]
As mentioned above, data matrix is incomplete so in order ro solve normal equations for lets say 0th row of W matrix. We build a new data 
[]describe how we build it with a bit of formulas


Regularization added from \cite{Zhou2008}
