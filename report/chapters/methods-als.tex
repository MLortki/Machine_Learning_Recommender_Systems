Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm used in this report is implemented by us. Each step of this method is roughly following: consider W as a constant and find optimal Z by using normal equations and vice versa. 

To prevent our model from overfitting we used regularized ALS, more specifically 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization}{Tikhonovs relugarizer}
. 

[formula of thing with description]
Reason behind this decision is, that 
\cite{Zhou2008}
 claims it prevents model from overfitting. Our observation is, that it works well when number of laten features is below 50, otherwise there is almost no improvement. 

We observed that solving normal equations for rows of W and Z do not depend on each other, which gives us possibility to seperate them.As mentioned above, data matrix is incomplete so in order to solve normal equations for rows of W and Z we create small subset of data, consisting only of ratings we need and corresponding rows of W or Z, depending for which matrix we solve the equation.
