\section{Models and Methods}

\subsection{Data analysis}
Include statistics about data 

\begin{itemize}
  \item ratio of non-zero entries
  \item how many ratings does each user make on average?
  \item by how many users is each item rated on average? 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Machine Learning methods}

\subsection{Evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Cross valdiation} A 10-fold cross validation is implemented
    for the whole training dataset to fix the hyperparameters. 
    TODO: what K should we choose to ensure enough valid users in dataset?   
  \item \textbf{Performance prediction} The training data was split into two
    sets of ratio 1:2, emulating the actual data ratio between Kaggle's training
    and test set. Doing the matrix factorization with this training/test set
    pair enables us to predict if we can expect a better performance on the
    kaggle dataset.  
    TODO: what is this ratio for this dataset? 
\end{enumerate}
