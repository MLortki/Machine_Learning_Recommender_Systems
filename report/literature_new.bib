@article{Gorrell1990,
abstract = {An algorithm based on the Generalized Hebbian Algorithm is described that allows the singular value decomposition of a dataset to be learned based on single observation pairs presented seri- ally. The algorithm has minimal mem- ory requirements, and is therefore in- teresting in the natural language do- main, where very large datasets are of- ten used, and datasets quickly become intractable. The technique is demon- strated on the task of learning word and letter bigram pairs from text.},
